# Paasmaker

Paasmaker is an open source, extensible, highly visible
platform-as-a-service (PaaS).

## Installation

The system is intended to be installed as easily as possible. We ship with
an installation script that will do most of the heavy lifting for you. On
Ubuntu 12.04 and greater, you should just be able to clone the repo, and run:

	$ ./install.py install/configs/example-paasmaker-hacking.yml

We do support installing a development version on OSX, 10.8 or greater. See
the documentation for the steps involved in getting that installed.

See the full documentation on installation at http://docs.paasmaker.org/.
